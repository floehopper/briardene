### Disclaimer

We have tried to make the following particulars as accurate as possible, but we're sure you will appreciate that we're obliged to point out that they cannot be relied on! We have also avoided the more fanciful value-laden adjectives.

## Outline

Briardene is a harmonious development of 35 houses on what was formerly Cathedral land, designed by [Donald Insall Associates](http://www.insall-lon.co.uk/), built in 1972-8, and described by Martin Roberts as "noteworthy" ([Durham: 1000 Years of History](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0752425374), Tempus, 2003, p. 174).

The development is an easy off-road walk to the Market Place where you will find a [Tesco Metro](http://www.tesco.com/storelocator/access/details.asp?bID=6029&l=D) and a [Marks & Spencer](http://www.marksandspencer.com/gp/store-locator/store-locator.html/278-3157984-8643465?ie=UTF8&viewID=details&postcode=DH1%203RB&storeID=2370&prevView=listing&client=mands_01&f_id=186&lon=-1.577010&lat=54.776010&db=GB) on Silver Street. You can walk through St Margaret's graveyard to [Framwellgate Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framwellgate_Bridge) or through the allotments to [Prebends Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebends_Bridge) at the end of the [South Bailey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bailey), and from here to the Cathedral and riverbanks. It is a five minute walk to St Margaret's CoE Primary School, a ten minute walk to the bus station, a fifteen minute walk to the railway station, and a twenty minute walk to the University Science Laboratories.

The sixteen houses of Lower Briardene (numbers 1-10 and 30-35) enclose a very large communal garden comprising banked lawns and mature trees and shrubs. To the front they look over the St Margaret's allotments and the wooded riverbank. Number 35 is aligned roughly along the east-west axis of the [Cathedral](http://www.durhamcathedral.co.uk/), which is visible from the first and second floors. From the second floor it is also possible to see the [Castle](http://www.dur.ac.uk/university.college/), and out as far as the hills above Houghton-le-Spring, about five miles away.

Road access is off Back Nevilledale Terrace, via Summerville. There is off-road parking, and a large internal garage. The house is built in darkbrown brick, faced with hanging tiles on the garden side of the first and second floors. On the ground floor there is kitchen/breakfast room with access to a patio and the garden, a sitting room (or dining room, or fourth bedroom), and a toilet. On the first floor, a second larger sitting room and the garage. On the second floor, three bedrooms and a bathroom. The loft space is partly boarded and useful for storage. The rooms on the ground and first floors are 8' (96") in height; those on the second floor are 7'8"
(92").

The house was built in 1977. It has gas-fired central heating and water heating, and the radiators have thermostatic valves (excepting the radiator in the bathroom). The windows and doors were replaced in 2011 with uPVC double-glazing. Many of the windows are horizontally-hinged opening sashes. The soffits, fascias & guttering were all replaced at the same time.

The house is in a good decorative state, with plain painted walls and white ceilings in all rooms. The internal doors are varnished dark wood, and the skirtings and door- and window-surrounds are generally white. There are plain fitted carpets in the hall, stairs, and landing, and in the two sitting rooms. The fittings in the kitchen and bathrooms are in good working order but unchanged during the current occupation.

Lower Briardene is on your right. Go up the footpath with the laurels on your right. The communal garden is on your right, between the two rows of houses. Go up the brick steps and turn right at the top. Walk down Back Nevilledale Terrace to the last modern house on your right.
