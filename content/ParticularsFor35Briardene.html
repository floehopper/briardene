<p><i>Disclaimer:</i> I have tried to make the following particulars
as accurate as possible, but I am sure you will appreciate that I am
obliged to point out that they cannot be relied on!  I have also
avoided the more fanciful value-laden adjectives.

</p><hr>

<h2><a name="outline">Outline</a></h2>

Briardene is a harmonious development of 35 houses on what was
formerly Cathedral land, designed by <a href="http://www.insall-lon.co.uk/">Donald&nbsp;Insall Associates,</a>
built in 1972-8, and described by Martin Roberts as "noteworthy"
(<i>Durham: 1000 Years of History</i>, Tempus, 2003, p. 174).  The
development is an easy off-road walk to Framwelgate Bridge and
Waitrose in the Gates shopping centre (through St Margaret's
graveyard), or to Prebends Bridge at the end of the South Bailey
(through the allotments and onto the riverbanks).  It is a five minute
walk to St Margaret's CoE Primary School, a ten minute walk to the bus
station, a fifteen minute walk to the railway station, and a twenty
minute walk to the University Science Laboratories.

<p><a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=54.7734&amp;lon=-1.5855&amp;scale=25000&amp;icon=x">Location
of Briardene using multimap.com (postcode DH1 4QU).</a> If you have
not used this service before, the red circle marks Briardene.  You can
click on the map to zoom in (zoom out by clicking the minus sign above
Zoom on the toolbar); selecting Aerial from the toolbar allows you to
overlay an image.

</p><p>The sixteen houses of Lower Briardene (numbers 1-10 and 30-35)
enclose a very large communal garden comprising banked lawns and
mature trees and shrubs.  To the front they look over the St
Margaret's allotments and the wooded riverbank.  Number 35 is aligned
roughly along the east-west axis of the Cathedral, which is visible
from the first and second floors.  From the second floor it is also
possible to see the Castle, and out as far as the wind-turbines on the
hills above Houghton-le-Spring, about five miles away.

</p><p>Road access is off Back Nevilledale Terrace, via Summerville.
There is off-road parking, and a large internal garage.  The house is
built in darkbrown brick, faced with hanging tiles on the garden side
of the first and second floors.  On the ground floor there is
kitchen/breakfast room with access to a patio and the garden, a
sitting room (or dining room, or fourth bedroom), and a toilet.  On
the first floor, a second larger sitting room and the garage.  On the
second floor, three bedrooms and a bathroom.  The loft space is partly
boarded and useful for storage.  The rooms on the ground and first
floors are 8' (96") in height; those on the second floor are 7'8"
(92").

</p><p>The house was built in 1977.  It has gas-fired central heating and
water heating, and the radiators have thermostatic valves (excepting
the radiator in the bathroom).  The boiler, hotwater tank and radiator
valves were all installed in 1996.  The windows and doors were replaced
in 2011 with uPVC double-glazing.  Many of the windows are horizontally-hinged
opening sashes.  The soffits, fascias &amp; guttering were all replaced at the same time.

</p><p>The house is in a good decorative state, with plain painted walls
and white ceilings in all rooms.  The internal doors are varnished
dark wood, and the skirtings and door- and window-surrounds are
generally white.  There are plain fitted carpets in the hall, stairs,
and landing, and in the two sitting rooms.  The fittings in the kitchen and bathrooms are in
good working order but unchanged during the current occupation.

<h2><a name="rooms">Room by room</a></h2>


<div class="rooms">

<p>The room measurements are taken from the brochure drawn up at the
time the previous owner bought the house (July 1996); they are only approximate.


</p><h3>Ground floor</h3>

front door is reached down eleven steps into a walled paved area,

uPVC double-glazed door.

herbaceous plants including a shrub bay tree.


</p><h3>First floor</h3>

overlooking Back Nevilledale Terrace.  Stripped floorboards, darkgreen
wood-stain.  Radiator under window (36"). Cornicing.

</p><p><b>Bathroom.</b> 7'5" by 5'.  Bath with shower and shower curtain,
toilet and pedestal basin (buttermilk, with pine bath-panel).  Tiled
walls.  Single frosted-glass window above bath.  Cork-tile flooring.

<h2><a name="additional">Additional information</a></h2>

<div class="rooms">

<p><b>Covenants.</b>

In common with other houses in the Briardene development, there are a
number of restrictive covenants (available on request).

</p><p><b>The Residents' Association.</b>

The Residents' Association acts on behalf of the Cathedral Dean and
Chapter.  It levies a fee each year to cover expenses such as
gardening, insurance and maintenance.  The fee for the current year is
£170 for 'non-mowers' and £60 for 'mowers'.

</p><p><b>Schools.</b>

The house is five minutes walk from St Margaret's CoE Primary School.
It is in the catchment area for Durham Johnson Comprehensive School.

</p><p><b>Council Tax.</b>

The house is currently Band E.  The annual Council Tax charge for the
year ending March 2006 is £1554.37.

</p><p><b>Water and sewage.</b>

A water meter has been installed.  The <i>fixed</i> charge for water
and sewage services in the year ending November 2005 was £81
(there was a volumetric charge on top of this).

</p><p><b>Parking.</b>

The streets around Briardene are part of the City's Residents' Parking
scheme.

</p><p><b>Parks.</b>

The communal gardens are not really suitable for ball games, but there
is a large flat area at the bottom of St Margaret's graveyard across
the road.  For swings, <i>etc</i>, there are two small parks in the
Viaduct area (10 minutes walk with a pushchair), and Wharton Park
above the railway station.

</p><p><b>Allotments.</b>

It is not possible to have a large vegetable patch in the garden, but
the St Margaret's allotments are just across the road.

<h2><a name="directions">Directions</a></h2>

<p><b>Driving.</b>

Driving along Margery Lane, turn into Summerville (left, if you have
come past Durham School, right if you have come from the traffic
lights at the bottom of the Peth).  The street bends to the left and
becomes Back Nevilledale Terrace.  Number&nbsp;35 is the first modern
house on the lefthand side.  Feel free to park in the drive.


</p><p><b>Walking.</b>

Walking along Margery Lane, turn into Briardene (left, if you have
come past Durham School, right if you have come from the traffic
lights at the bottom of the Peth).  Lower Briardene is on your right.
Go up the footpath with the laurels on your right.  The communal
garden is on your right, between the two rows of houses.  Go up the
brick steps and turn right at the top.  Walk down Back Nevilledale
Terrace to the last modern house on your right.
